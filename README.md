## 1. Two Sum

1.Build a hash table(key is the value of input array, value is the index of input array)\
2.Traverse the input array and use the hash table to search for the second number

## 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
1.Use headIndex and endIndex to indicate current substring\
2.Use hash table curSubstr to store all characters in current substring\
3.
```
Increase endIndex by 1 until the end
    if s[endIndex] is in the hash table
        duplicatedCharIndex = curSubstr[s[endIndex]]
        remove all the elements from headIndex to duplicatedCharIndex in curSubstr
        move headIndex to the right of the duplicated character (headIndex = duplicatedCharIndex + 1)
    else
        add [s[endIndex]]endIndex to curSubstr

    if length of the current substring is longer than maxSubstrLen, update maxSubstrLen.Otherwise continue
```

## 4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays
Gist of the algorithm.
Use binary search to find the boundry that separate both arrays into left and right part.
Make sure all the elemnts in the left part of the first array are smaller than the elements in the right part of the second array, and the elements in the left part of the second array are smaller than the elements in the right part of the first array.


## 70. Climbing Stairs
```
f(1) = 1
f(2) = 2
f(n) = f(n-2) + f(n-1)
```
